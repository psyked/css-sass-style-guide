## SCSS Template Project
- - -
We have an SASS / CSS Structure project on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mmtdigital/mmtdigital-sass-structure) which outlines the basic structure for our SCSS source files.

All projects should follow the **folder structure** and use the **mixins** included in this project, which will make it much easier to share
improvements between multiple projects and teams.

All you need to do is:
1. Download the latest version of the source files from Bitbucket.
2. Drop the files into your project.
3. Use it as a scaffold for your structuring your source files and use our existing collection of mixins.
